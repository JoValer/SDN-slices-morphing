# Networking 2021/2022
This is the _Softwarized and virtualized mobile networks_ (aka _Networking II_) group project's repository by [**Daniele Della Pietra**](https://github.com/dellastone), [**Matteo Mazzonelli**](https://github.com/MatteoMazzonelli) and [**Giovanni Valer**](https://github.com/jo-valer).

‚Ñπ We have implemented two different scenarios, each with its own topology and simulations.

## üìÅ <a href="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/tree/main/scenario_1">`1st scenario`</a>

Here we imagine having a city, whose network is divided in 2 slices: the first (from now on: _slice_1_) is dedicated to **citizens' traffic** while the second (_slice_2_) is dedicated to **essential services** (eg. police, hospital).

It might happen that a natural disaster, boycott, or accident leads to irreparable damages to a part of the network (let's imagine switch _s4_ unreachable).

In such a situation we would like to dynamically change the slices, in order to have _slice_1_ overlaying _slice_2_, an so allowing communication between _h4_ and _h5_. Furthermore, we require that the available throughput of switch _s2_ is 80% dedicated to _slice_2_, since essential services could need even more capability in case of natural disaster.

### Key summary
- ‚úÖ **Dynamical slices' morphing**
- ‚úÖ **Essential services have 80% of dedicated throughput**

### üñß Topology

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo
Launch network:
  ```
  ryu-manager dynamic_slicing.py & sudo python3 network.py
  ```

üëâ **WHEN SWITCH 4 IS ON:**

**Test reachability** by running ```mininet> pingall```
<br><img src="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/blob/main/scenario_1/images/pingall_ON.jpg" width="40%" height="40%"><br>


Use command ```dpctl dump-flows``` to show the flow tables. Notice that _h4_ communicates with _h5_ through switch _s4_:

**Test bandwidth** of slices with ```iperf```

üëâ **WHEN SWITCH 4 IS UNREACHABLE:**

Let's use the same commands after event: **'Switch 4 ‚Äì OFF'**

**Test reachability** by running ```mininet> pingall```
<br><img src="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/blob/main/scenario_1/images/pingall_OFF.jpg" width="40%" height="40%"><br>
As we can see slicing is preserved, citizens don't have access to essential services slice, and vice versa.


Use command ```dpctl dump-flows``` to show the flow tables. Notice that _h4_ communicates with _h5_ through citizens' slice:

**Test bandwidth** of slices with ```iperf```
<br><img src="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/blob/main/scenario_1/images/bandwidth_OFF.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br>
80% of available bandwidth is used by essential services and 20% by citizens, just as desired.

### Shut down network
`mininet> exit`

`$ sudo mn -c`

## üìÅ <a href="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/tree/main/scenario_2">`2nd scenario`</a>

In this second scenario we have the network of a classroom. When students work on group projects, the different goups can't communicate "_too much_". So there are three slices which are interconnected by a fourth one (let's assume it's the teacher).

Moreover, not every single packet is allowed to pass through _connect_slice_: in fact there is a maximum amount of UDP packets sendable between slices, and when the threshold is exceeded the UDP packets are discarded.


### Key summary
- ‚úÖ **Connecting SDN slices**
- ‚úÖ **Stateful packet filtering**: exceeding UDP packets are discarded

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo
Launch network:
  ```
  ./run_controllers.sh & sudo python3 network.py
  ```
**Test reachability** by running ```mininet> pingall```
<br><img src="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/blob/main/scenario_2/images/pingall.jpg" width="40%" height="40%"><br>

Use command ```mininet> h1 ping h10``` and ```dpctl dump-flows``` in order to check packets' flow from _h1_ to _h10_ through connecting slice (switch _s6_):
<br><img src="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/blob/main/scenario_2/images/ping_h1_h10.jpg" width="120%" height="120%"><br>

Send UDP packets from _slice 3_ to _slice 1_:
<br><img src="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/blob/main/scenario_2/images/test_UDP.jpg" width="50%" height="50%"><br>
After a certain amount of UDP packets transmitted, **switch _s6_ stops UDP connection** between _slice 1_ and _slice 3_. This event **doesn't affect TCP and ICMP packets' flows**.

Every 60 seconds UDP connections are restored and packets' counters are reset:

### Shut down network
`mininet> exit`

`$ sudo mn -c`
