# Networking 2021/2022
This is the _Softwarized and virtualized mobile networks_ (aka _Networking II_) group project's repository by **Daniele Della Pietra**, **Matteo Mazzonelli**, and **Giovanni Valer**.

‚Ñπ We have implemented two different scenarios, each with its own topology and simulations.

## üìÅ <a href="https://github.com/jo-valer/Networking/tree/main/scenario_1">`1st scenario`</a>

Here we imagine having a city, whose network is divided in 2 slices: the first (from now on: _slice_1_) is dedicated to **citizens' traffic** while the second (_slice_2_) is dedicated to **essential services** (eg. police, hospital).

It might happen that a natural disaster, boycott, or accident leads to irreparable damages to a part of the network (let's imagine switch 4 unreachable).

In such a situation we would like to dynamically change the slices, in order to have _slice_1_ overlay _slice_2_, an so allowing communication between _h4_ and _h5_. Furthermore, we require that the available throughput of switch 2 is 80% dedicated to _slice_2_, since essential services could need even more capability in case of natural disaster.

### Morphing network slices

‚Ä¢ GOAL: to enable RYU SDN controller to build network slices and dynamically modify their topology

‚Ä¢ To consider that each network node might host¬´services¬ª, that in this case will be represented by virtual switches/routers

‚Ä¢ The SDN controller will not only slice but reprogram connectivity within the slice

### Launch
````
ryu-manager dynamic_slicing.py &
sudo python3 network.py
````
### Shut down network
````
exit
sudo mn -c
````
### Commands
````
nodes // Available nodes
links // Show links
dump // process ID in linux and eth address
h1 ifconfig 
h1 ls // working directory
h1 ping -c3 h4 // ping 3 packets
dpctl dump-flows // show flow tables
iperf h1 h2 // testing TCP bandwidth between h1 and h2
