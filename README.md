# Networking 2021/2022
This is the _Softwarized and virtualized mobile networks_ (aka _Networking II_) group project's repository by Daniele Della Pietra, Matteo Mazzonelli, and Giovanni Valer.

‚Ñπ We have implemented two different scenarios, each with its own topology and simulations.

### Morphing network slices

‚Ä¢ GOAL: to enable RYU SDN controller to build network slices and dynamically modify their topology

‚Ä¢ To consider that each network node might host¬´services¬ª, that in this case will be represented by virtual switches/routers

‚Ä¢ The SDN controller will not only slice but reprogram connectivity within the slice

### Launch
````
ryu-manager dynamic_slicing.py &
sudo python3 network.py
````
### Shut down network
````
exit
sudo mn -c
````
### Commands
````
nodes // Available nodes
links // Show links
dump // process ID in linux and eth address
h1 ifconfig 
h1 ls // working directory
h1 ping -c3 h4 // ping 3 packets
dpctl dump-flows // show flow tables
iperf h1 h2 // testing TCP bandwidth between h1 and h2
